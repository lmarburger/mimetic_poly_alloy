# Mimetic Poly-Alloy

A [Quicksilver][]-inspired JavaScript search that favors consecutive matching
characters.

Quicksilver is great to search using acronyms or shorthand. Where it's not a
good fit is searching through lists of keywords.

The basic approach is to compute a score by counting the number of matched
characters, add a point if it matches the start of a word, and return 2 raised
to the power of the score.

    "this is a test".score("test")  // 32

This search was calculated as such: 2<sup>(4 + 1)</sup>.

    "this is a test".score("is")  // 8
    "this is a test".score("hi")  // 4

Here you can see that a match at the start of a word ranks much higher than in
the middle. More examples can be found in the [accompanying tests][tests].

## Usage

Mimetic Poly-Alloy uses the same API as Quicksilver. Drop the JavaScript file on
your site and use the `score` method on a string of keywords. Give it a string
to search for and it will return a score as a float.

    list_of_keywords.score(search)
